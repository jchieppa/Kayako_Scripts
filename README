INTRODUCTION
============
Perl script to save the laborious task of upgrading Kayako download helpdesk by hand.  If 
you have comments or suggestions please direct them to jchieppa AT gmail DOT com or via fork
and pull request.

INSTALLATION
============
Copy the kayako_upgrade.pl script to your htdocs root directory.

Script expects that you have already downloaded and extracted the required helpdesk and 
geoip tarballs and that a valid key.php exists in your existing installation dir.

During the installation the script will prompt you for your existing source directory as well
as the new source directories.  When entering any directory name (source, geoip, tinymce patch)
enter only the directory name, i.e. fusion-stable-sourceobf-4-64-1-4827 not the full path.

When prompted a (Y/n) the script assumes Yes on Y/y or enter and no on any other character.

We use Gary's 'CustomTweaks' App.  If you do not please comment out or remove lines 93-95.

CONFIGURATION
=============
Edit the script to define variables relevant to your installation.  At minimum you need to 
set the following variables:

# SET YOUR DATABASE VARIABLES
my $dbuser = 'username';
my $dbpass = 'password';
my $dbname = 'kayako';

# SET YOUR HTDOCS ROOT 
my $path = "/www/htdocs";
