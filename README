# kayako_upgrade.pl script
##########################

INTRODUCTION
============
Perl script to save the laborious task of upgrading Kayako download helpdesk by hand.  If 
you have comments or suggestions please direct them to jchieppa AT gmail DOT com or via fork
and pull request.

INSTALLATION
============
Copy the kayako_upgrade.pl script to your htdocs root directory.

Script expects that you have already downloaded and extracted the required helpdesk and 
geoip tarballs and that a valid key.php exists in your existing installation dir.

During the installation the script will prompt you for your existing source directory as well
as the new source directories.  When entering any directory name (source, geoip, tinymce patch)
enter only the directory name, i.e. fusion-stable-sourceobf-4-64-1-4827 not the full path.

When prompted a (Y/n) the script assumes Yes on Y/y or enter and no on any other character.

We use Gary's 'CustomTweaks' App.  If you do not please comment out or remove lines 99-101.

CONFIGURATION
=============
Edit the script to define variables relevant to your installation.  At minimum you need to 
set the following variables:

# SET YOUR DATABASE VARIABLES
my $dbuser = 'username';
my $dbpass = 'password';
my $dbname = 'kayako';

# SET YOUR HTDOCS ROOT 
my $path = "/www/htdocs";

# SET YOUR HELPDESK URL
my $hdurl = "http://helpdesk.domain.com";

Make sure you leave off the trailing / of the url as it's manually input throughout the script
to prevent visual munging of variable & path.

# SET APACHE USER & GROUP
my $apache = "nobody.www";

We run Apache under nobody user, thus we give file and directory ownership to nobody.www 
Chanage this variable as needed

RFC822 Patch.  Currently email parser will fail on any email that doesn't conform to RFC822 
stopping all mail pickup of any messages newer than the failed message.  Kayako has a non published
patch to resolve this.  Upload the folder RFC822PATCH to your $path root directory prior to running
the upgrade script
